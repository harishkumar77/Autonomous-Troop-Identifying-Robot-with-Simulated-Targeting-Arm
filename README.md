# Autonomous-Troop-Identifying-Robot-with-Simulated-Targeting-Arm
26th November 2024

This project combines computer vision with robotics to automate detection and targeting in a simulated military environment. Using a YOLO v5 model for real-time person detection, the system identifies enemy troops in an image. Once detected, a simulated Baxter robot in pybullet simulation is instructed to aim at these targets.
